        <p> Every year, a mother duck comes to nest in the main court of St Cathrarine's College, Cambridge.
        She makes a nest in one of the flowerpots - last year it was one near the main hall - and sits on her eggs until they hatch.
        When they've hatched, she leads her babies in a procession across the main court and out the back of the college towards the river.
        Students and staff make sure the mother duck and her babies get the river safely.
        </p>
