<H1> The St Cathrine's College Duck </H1>
    <p> Every year, a mother duck comes to nest in the main court of St Cathrarine's College, Cambridge. 
    She makes a nest in one of the flowerpots - last year it was one near the main hall - and sits on her eggs until they hatch.
    When they've hatched, she leads her babies in a procession across the main court and out the back of the college towards the river. 
    Students and staff make sure the mother duck and her babies get the river safely.
